    Ruby.
  talk_title:   Concurrency and distributed systems with JRuby
  talk_type:    30min
  talk_summary: |
    You probably code on a machine with two, if not four, or even eight cores.
    Yet your Ruby application will use only one of them. Concurrency is hard,
    but it’s even harder when you don’t have the environment, or the tools, to
    do it properly.

    JRuby gives you these tools, and so much more. I’ll show you how you can
    use JRuby to write concurrent code, and even distributed systems without
    having to think about threads, locks and the complexity that they cause.

    Running on the JVM is like standing on the shoulders of giants. Why not
    use Akka, an actor framework written in Scala, or Storm, a distributed
    real time computation system written in Clojure? I’ll explain how, and
    show you many more examples on how to use the full power of the JVM from
    the comfort of Ruby.

  talk_title:   Deploy, Scale and Sleep Better with JRuby
  talk_type:    30min
  talk_summary: |
    JRuby deployments have fewer moving parts and consume less memory than
    traditional Ruby deployments, but to deploy your apps on the JVM, you need
    to learn some new approaches. This talk will introduce you to three JRuby
    deployment strategies that will give you the performance and scalability
    you need while letting you use the language you love.

    You'll learn how Warbler can be used to create a binary file from a Ruby
    web application. Then we'll discuss how the light-weight Trinidad web
    server can be used to create a flexible, modular deployment that still
    feels friendly and familiar. Finally, you'll learn how to power an
    application with TorqueBox, an all-in-one environment that includes
    built-in support for messaging, scheduling and daemons.

  talk_title:   Benchmarking the right way with Perfer
  talk_type:    30min
  talk_summary: |
    Ever wondered what it would take to have stable and reliable measurements
    for your performance? Or wished to know the evolution of it across
    releases and rubies? Or simply to know how fast or slow is some code?
    Perfer is a benchmarking tool, intending to solve these, and to provide an
    easy way to store, transform and compare the results and to make a graph
    of it. This is the result of a GSoC project of this year, so it's fresh
    and new, come and see yourself!

    The talk will start with some benchmarking best practices, explaining why
    using the benchmark stdlib is usually not sufficient. I will then explain
    Perfer's approach and show how to use it and how it can be useful in
    real-world examples.

    Seven years ago i got asked to join a friends startup. Very simple stuff,
    one web server, editing php scripts live. That was the start of a
    fantastic journey that has now taken me to ad analytics startup Burt,
    where we show that there's more to metrics the clicks. On a normal day, we
    process tens of thousands of requests per second, in real time, in JRuby.
    On my spare time, i sing in two metal bands, play competitive Starcraft II
    and collect single malts.
  talk_title:   Gotcha! JRuby performance issues that will come back to bite you
  talk_type:    30min
  talk_summary: |
    With JRuby you can take the simplicity of Ruby and scale up to to very
    complex systems with little effort. But there are monsters hiding in the
    shadows, waiting to strike. That class you just build might work fine in
    your tests, but what happens when you run it ten thousand times per
    second? At Burt we've learned a lot of these lessons the hard way. Now you
    don't have to! Let me show you some of the most common issues you're gonna
    run in to, how you can work around them and the tools that will help you
    on the way.

  talk_title:   Static or dynamic typing? Why not both? Integrating JRuby and Scala
  talk_type:    30min
  talk_summary: |
    One of the advantages of JRuby is that, running on the JVM, it is
    relatively easy to integrate it with other JVM languages and libraries.
    One language that has been generating a lot of interest lately is Scala.
    Apart from being a "better Java", Scala brings to the table many
    interesting features such as:

    A hybrid object-oriented/functional programming model, including such
    concepts as pattern matching, immutable values, first-class functions and
    closures.
    An Actor framework for easy scalability and concurrency
    A Parser Combinator library for easily writing parsers
    and many other things
    While the JRuby team has added some features to easily call Scala code
    from JRuby in 1.6.0 and 1.6.6, calling JRuby from Scala still relies on
    the bare JRuby embedding APIs.
    
    In this session we will cover the new features for calling Scala from
    JRuby, as well as introducing an interoperability library called
    (Scuby)[http://github.com/abstracc/scuby] that we built for easing the
    pain of calling JRuby from Scala. It is recommended that attendees have
    some Scala knowledge to take full advantage of the session.

    work at Datek Wireless ( http://datek.no/ ) developing fleet control
    systems for airports and the evenings are divided between family, open
    source development and jujutsu. I am currently most active in the Ruboto
    project, JRuby on Android.

    Android has made great advances the last couple of years, and is one
    of the major actors in the phone ad tablet markets.

    The main programming language on Android is Java. Android offers a
    comprehensive API to apps running on the Dalvik VM. The API covers a
    large part of the Java standard library in addition to Android
    specific APIs. Android includes tooling to convert Java .class files
    to Dalvik VM compatible class files.

    Ruboto uses JRuby to allow you to run Ruby scripts on the Dalvik VM.
    Using Ruby code, you have access to the complete Android API.

    Currently, there are two offerings: ruboto and ruboto-irb. Ruboto is
    a framework and tool chain to develop stand-alone Android apps in
    Ruby. Ruboto-IRB is an interactive Ruby environment for learning,
    exploration, development, and testing.

    This presentation will introduce the different parts of Ruboto:

    * Installation
    * Hello World
    * Development tools
    * Emulator
    * Combine Java and Ruby in the same project
    * Limitations
    * Release

    There is a lot happening both on Android, JRuby, and Ruboto, and I'd
    like to present the last months development, and present the road map
    for the project.

    See what Ruboto has to offer!

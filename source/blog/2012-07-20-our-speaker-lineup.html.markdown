We're thrilled to finally announce our full lineup of speakers. 

Despite JRubyConf EU coming about at the relative last-minute, we think our speaker lineup is superb. JRubyConf EU in its infancy is a one-day event and, this time around, we were only able to accommodate a limited number of talks. Nonetheless all of the proposals we received were of a very high standard.

Without further ado, here are the speakers for the first European JRubyConf:

* **Benoît Daloze** ([@eregontp][eregontp]): A student at the Université catholique de Louvain, Benoît is currently working on the 2012 Google Summer of Code (GSOC) project, [Perfer][perfer], a benchmarking tool for all Ruby implementations.
* **David Tollmyr** ([@effata][effata]): Lead Developer at advertising startup Burt in Gothenburg, Sweden. Big data guy by day. Metal Singer by night.
* **Joe Kutner** ([@codefinger][codefinger]): Hailing from sunny Huntsville, Alabama, Joe is an independent consultant building Ruby and Rails applications. He also literally wrote [the book on JRuby deployment][deploying-with-jruby].
* **Mario Camou** ([@thedoc][thedoc]): Master Architect and Co-founder of Abstra.cc, where he is involved in several projects using JRuby, Scala and combinations thereof.
* **Theo Hultberg** ([@iconara][iconara]): Chief Architect, also at Burt. Theo has built distributed analytics systems that handle tens of millions of messages per day – all in Ruby.
* **Tim Lossen** ([@tlossen][tlossen]): By day, a backend engineer at Berlin social gaming startup [Wooga](http://wooga.com). Secret Hardware hacker by night.
* **Toby Crawley** ([@tcrawley][tcrawley]): Core member of the TorqueBox team at Red Hat, Toby Crawley is spearheading the integration of Java and Ruby.
* **Tom Enebo** ([@tom_enebo][tom_enebo]): Member of the JRuby Core Team. Enough said.
* **Uwe Kubosch**: Senior Software Developer at Datek Wireless AS. Now heading the [ruboto][Ruboto] project, he's been putting it to intriguing uses.

We hope you're just as excited about our lineup as we are. If you haven't registered yet, [there are still some tickets available](http://eurucamp2012.eventbrite.com/).

_Looking forward to seeing you next month in Berlin!_

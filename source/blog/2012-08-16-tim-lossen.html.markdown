We have some very sad news: because of illness, [Tim Lossen][@tlossen]
will not make it to the conference tomorrow to give his planned talk
on building a game server with JRuby.

**Michael Hunger** ([@mesirii][@mesirii]) and **Stefan Plantikow** ([@boggle][@boggle])
will step in and give two short (15-minute) talks: on Neo4j-JRuby
integration, and Andromeda (a dataflow concurrency framework), respectively.

_I, and all the team, wish Tim all the best for a speedy recovery! Get well soon, Tim!_

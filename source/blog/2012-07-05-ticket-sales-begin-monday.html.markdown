eurucamp has always been designed to be accessible for all. While we're more
expensive than last year, we should still be affordable for everyone who wants
to come. We're planning a very ambitious programme of talks and activities.


What's included in the ticket price:

- **activities**: talks and outdoor activities.
- **great coffee, drinks, snacks and meals**


What's not included in the ticket price:

- **accommodation**: you need to decide for yourself where you want to stay.
  We'll be updating our [venue page][venue] over the next week with more
  details about the options available to you.
- **transport to/and from the venue**: you'll have to buy your own tickets.
 there will be a small charge for the CampBus.
- **equipment rental for some activities**


There will be no early-bird discounts. However, we expect the first batch to
sell out fast.

There will be a discount of 30% for students and unemployed.
